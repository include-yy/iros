Here are already some packages about emacs and ros:

- [[https://github.com/code-iai/ros_emacs_utils][ros_emacs_utils -- Emacs tools for ROS]]
- [[https://github.com/mbeutelspacher/ros.el][ros.el -- A package to ease the interaction ROS nodes and the development of ROS software]]

This repo is an attempt to make an igist-like(or magit-like) interface for emacs to work with ROS.
